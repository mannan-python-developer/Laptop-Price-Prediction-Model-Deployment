## Laptop Price Prediction Web App using Flask

### Overview:
This project involves the deployment of a machine learning model for predicting laptop prices through a web application built with Flask. The model, trained on a dataset containing various laptop specifications, allows users to input specific details of a laptop and obtain an estimated price.

### User Interface:
![User Interface](https://github.com/mannan-python-developer/Laptop-Price-Prediction-Model-Deployment-/blob/main/Demo.png)

### Technologies Used:
- **Flask**: Used as the web application framework to handle user requests and responses.
- **Pandas**: Employed for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Utilized for training and loading the machine learning model.
- **HTML/CSS/Bootstrap**: Used for designing the user interface of the web application.
- **JavaScript/jQuery**: Employed for dynamic population of dropdown menus and handling asynchronous requests.

### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Dropdowns**: Users can select laptop attributes such as company, product, CPU, GPU, etc., through dynamically populated dropdown menus.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizes a trained machine learning model to predict laptop prices based on user inputs.
- **Responsive Design**: The web app interface is designed to be user-friendly and responsive across different devices.

### How to Use:
1. **Select Laptop Attributes**: Users can choose laptop attributes such as company, product, CPU, GPU, etc., from the dropdown menus.
2. **Submit and Predict**: After selecting the desired attributes, users can click the "Predict Price" button to get the estimated price of the laptop.

### Deployment Details:
The Flask app is deployed and hosted on a server, making it accessible to users over the internet. Users can access the app through a web browser on any device with an internet connection.

### Future Improvements:
- **Enhanced User Interface**: Implementing additional features and visual enhancements to improve user experience.
- **Model Refinement**: Continuously refining the machine learning model to improve prediction accuracy.
